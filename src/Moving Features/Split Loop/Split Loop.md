# Split Loop
## Why?
- You see loops that are doing different things at once. 
If you are doing different things in the same loop, then whenever you need the loop you have to understand both things.
### Benefits:
- The code is more easy to undertand, change or maintain.
## What?
- Splitting the loop. 
## How?
- Copy the loop
- Identity and eliminate duplicates
- Test
